GOVERNANCE INTERFACE // PROTOCOL
I. SYSTEM STATE
Format: Automated logic management. Status: Active. Visitor Role: Interloper. Supervision: None.

II. CONSTRAINT ARCHITECTURE
Variable: Execution (Abundant). Bottleneck: Cognitive Governance. Navigation: Disabled. Mode: Systemic Discipline. Structure: Incentive Architectures / Verification Loops.

STRUCTURAL HIERARCHY
CONSTRAINT: Non-negotiable economic reality.
PROTOCOL: System engineering configuration.
FAILURE MODE: Systemic drift / Legacy maintenance.
CONSEQUENCE: Unit obsolescence.
III. VERIFICATION LOGIC
Theory: Rejected. Requirement: Verifiable Unit of Output. Proof: Structural replacement of Firm.

IV. FILTER MECHANICS
Target: Logic competence.

PROFILE: INVESTOR Persuasion: 0%. Recognition: Power displacement to Architecture.

PROFILE: MANAGER Reaction: Rejection reflex. Trigger: Role obsolescence.

PROFILE: ASPIRANT Incentive: Structural asymmetry. Mechanism: Operation with zero structural drag.

V. CLASSIFICATION
Class: Sovereign Node. Context: Geographically agnostic. Focus: Governance / Control. Exclusion: Generative features / Advisory models. Alignment: System Theory.

VI. INFRASTRUCTURE SPECS
Architecture: Scale-to-Zero. State: Containerized / Portable. Idle Cost: 0. Maintenance: 0. Function: Self-healing protocol.
