# SCROLL FRICTION DESIGN
## Cognitive Load Gradient
*(SSoT · Derived from Sequential System Architecture)*

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **gradient of cognitive friction** across the single-scroll execution path.

Its function is to:
- Control reader fatigue.
- Impose asymmetry between casual and disciplined readers.
- Ensure the site filters without interaction.

This is not a visual or copy document.
It governs **density, pacing, and omission**.

---

## Global Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Friction increases before it resolves.
- No section compensates for the previous one.
- Empty space is a constraint, not decoration.
- Omission is intentional and permanent.
- No section optimizes for comfort.

## Section-by-Section Gradient

---

### 1. SYSTEM STATE

**Cognitive Function**
- Immediate disorientation.
- Removal of user agency.

**Density**
- Text: Minimal (1–2 short declarative lines).

**Scroll Rhythm**
- Very fast.
- No resistance.

**Imposes**
- Nothing to “read into”.
- No context offered.

**Omissions**
- No explanation.
- No framing.
- No orientation.

**Reader Effect**
- Either immediate exit or forced recalibration.

**Reader Effect**
- Cognitive pressure.
- Early fatigue signal.

- Increased attentional cost.

---

### 4. FAILURE MODE

**Cognitive Function**
- Confinement.
- Elimination of reformist exits.

**Density**
- High.
- Sustained.

**Vacuum**
- Low.
- Claustrophobic.

- Slow.
- Deliberately heavy.

**Imposes**
- Structural inevitability.
- No corrective path.

**Omissions**
- No blame.
- No moral framing.
- No turnaround narrative.

**Reader Effect**
- Psychological compression.
- Maximum dropout point.

---

### 5. REPLACEMENT UNIT

**Cognitive Function**
- Reconfiguration.
- Shift of unit of analysis.

**Density**
- Medium.
- Cleaner than previous sections.

**Vacuum**
- Medium-high.
- Controlled release.

**Scroll Rhythm**
- Stabilized.
- Measured.

**Imposes**
- New structural object.
- Not a human identity.

**Omissions**
- No “how-to”.
- No role modeling.
- No aspirational tone.

**Reader Effect**
- Cognitive reset without relief.
- Structural recognition.

---

### 6. GOVERNANCE SCARCITY

**Cognitive Function**
- Re-centering of power.
- Elevation of decision over execution.

**Density**
- High.
- Abstract but precise.

**Vacuum**
- Low.

**Scroll Rhythm**
- Slow.
- Sustained attention required.

**Imposes**
- New scarcity logic.
- New advantage criterion.

**Omissions**
- No tools.
- No frameworks.
- No optimization advice.

**Reader Effect**
- High cognitive demand.
- Alignment checkpoint.

---

### 7. SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCES

**Cognitive Function**
- Cooling.
- Historical distancing.

**Density**
- Medium.

**Vacuum**
- High.
- Expansive spacing.

**Scroll Rhythm**
- Slow.
- Decelerating.

**Imposes**
- Irreversibility.
- Absence of social reassurance.

**Omissions**
- No optimism.
- No democratization narrative.
- No ethical resolution.

**Reader Effect**
- Emotional flattening.
- Intellectual closure.

---

### 8. ACTION (ACQUISITION)

**Cognitive Function**
- Silent resolution.
- Optional closure.

**Density**
- Very low.

**Vacuum**
- Extreme.

**Scroll Rhythm**
- Fast.
- Unobstructed.

**Imposes**
- Action as side-effect.
- No invitation.

**Omissions**
- No urgency.
- No repetition.
- No persuasion.

**Reader Effect**
- Purchase feels procedural.
- Exit without ceremony.

---

## Integrity Check

This gradient is correct if:

- A casual reader exits before Section 4.
- A disciplined reader reaches the end without feeling “helped”.
- No section feels rewarding on its own.

Failure conditions:
- Relief appears too early.
- Curiosity replaces pressure.
- Action feels encouraged.

---

## Status

APPROVED  
Frozen as SSoT for:
- First viewport audit.
- Wireframe logic.
- Copy execution.

No further conceptual iteration permitted.
